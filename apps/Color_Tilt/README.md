# Color Tilt / Color Tilt Game
##### By: Kenneth Brandon December 2016
## Color Tilt Game:
Turning the cube will change the cube's color. **Try to match the center color.**

#### How it works:
The app reads in the accelerometer data and translates it's values into colors.

The X accelerometer turns into red, Y into green, and Z into blue. When X axis is down, the red component of the color will be zero, when it is up, red will be full at 255.

#### Easter Egg:
Tap any side 3 times quickly and the red axis will only show the red channel, the green axis will show only the green channel, and the blue axis will show only the blue channel. This will allow you to better understand how the colors are mixed.

#### Music
Taping any side will turn the music on or off
