# Tilt Color
##### By: Kenneth Brandon December 2016

Turning the cube will change the cube's color.

The app reads in the accelerometer data and translates it's values into colors.

The X accelerometer turns into red, Y into green, and Z into blue.
When X is down, red will be zero, when it is up red will be 255.
### Using the app
* Tapping on opposite sides 0 and 1 speedup/slowdown the animation.
* Tapping on opposite sides 2 and 3 change the phase of the animation.
* Tapping on opposite sides 4 and 5 will transition through 5 songs and silence

### Cube sides:
```
      [4]
[0][2][1][3]
      [5]
```
