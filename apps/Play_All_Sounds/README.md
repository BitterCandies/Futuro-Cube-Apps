# Play ALL Sounds
##### By Kenneth Brandon - July 2013
This is test program to play each sound.  The intention was to be able to find interesting sounds that shipped with the device to use in my own apps.

### Usage:
* Tapping on the Red + button will play the next sound
* Tapping on the Blue - button will play the previous sound
* Tapping on the White play button will play the current sound
* Tapping on the White pause button will stop the playing of the current sount
* Tapping on the blank sides will tell you which index was played

### Notes:
This app is large, and will take a lot of space.  It only plays 273 known sounds, not all sounds on device.
