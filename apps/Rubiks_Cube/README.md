# Rubik's Cube
##### Modified from: [example_5_animated_rubiks.p](http://www.futurocube.com/sdk/)
##### Modifications By: Kenneth Brandon  

###Installing
Unlike the other apps, this one must be installed using the .zip file.  Using Rubik's Futuro Cube Suite, just drop the [Rubiks_Cube.zip](Rubiks_Cube.zip) file on the side you want the app to go.

### Changes made:
* Correct colors and color scheme
* Added Solve Music
* Added Solve Animation
* Added Shake to Scramble
* Added colorful Icon
* Added custom sounds for twisting
* Added custom sounds for menu and description

### Original Readme:
This example shows simple implementation of rubik's cube with animated rotations.
Direction of rotation is determined by inclination of tapped side. SolveDir function
reads accelerometer data and compares with threshold for direction.  
Also each move is stored into variable, so the progress is never lost.
